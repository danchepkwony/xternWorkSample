# Xtern Work Sample

## Introduction

I decided to follow the example 10-week activity plan of 10 weekly group dinners, 5 recreational activities, and one conference or Ted Talk event.

All of the workspaces have conference halls, but some don’t detail the capacity of their conference rooms. With this limited data and since we are conveniently hosted at IUPUI, Hine Hall Auditorium is the best choice.

For the recreational activities and group dinners, we’ll need to gather data on potential restaurants and venues.

## Methods

I used Google Maps API to find nearby restaurants and recreational options for each workspace. Then, I found the top 20 nearby restaurants and the top 10 recreational options for each workspace. To find the top 20 restaurants, I filtered out restaurants with a price level lower than 1, which are usually fast food options, then, sorted them based on rating. 

For the activities, I sorted them based on the amount of user reviews rather than rating value itself. Restaurants are often reviewed often and accurately; customers submit good and bad reviews. However, recreational places are hardly reviewed. When I initially ordered the activity places by rating, the top activity was an abandoned White Castle. Popular recreational places are reviewed by a larger number of people, so it's a better reflection of place quality.

In addition, I computed the distance between the housing and each workspace.

The data collected is limited. Google Maps API only allows for 60 results per query. I could only receive 60 results from nearby restaurants. I made separate queries for each type of activity, so there’s a decent amount of data collected on activities. However, those queries were still limited.

The activity places collected using Google Map's API were not ideal. Ranking these places with rating with no respect given to the amount of user ratings led to misleading results. A "Vintage" White Castle building has 5 stars on Google with only 2 reviews. With more time, I would collect data on the amount of user reviews and other metrics to better decice place quality.

With this data, we can now choose the best workspace.

## Conclusion

I believe Industrious Mass Ave is the best workspace for Xterns this summer. 

It is the most proximal to the housing, has the highest top 20 nearby restaurant average rating, and has the lowest average distance for the top 20 nearby activities. 

The one concern I have is the number of different activity types nearby. However, this number is based on Google’s Place types and limited to a 5 mile radius. The benefits of this workspace outweigh the potential of having to choose two similar activities within a 5 mile radius or the minor inconvenience of looking further than 5 miles for a biweekly activity.  

I created the plan assuming the Xtern program starts June 2, 2022.
